## Overview

This is my 11th challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style a coming soon landing page based on the design assets provided. (static **JPG** images)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
